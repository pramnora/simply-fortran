## Introduction

I was looking through Linux Mint OS/Operating System...file manager, called: Snap;  
-(more specifically, I was peering through the 'programming' related section of Snap software)-;    
when, all of a sudden, I came across a link allowing me to download a Fortran compiler called: SimplyFortran;  
so, I thought to myself I've never tried using Fortran before; therefore, why not...?  

But, of course, when it comes to learning to use any programming language that's *new*;  
then, there will be a **learning curve** to go climb.
