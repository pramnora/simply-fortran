## Introduction

Using Linux Mint OS/Operating System...I had downloaded a software file manager, called: Snap;  
whilst I was peering through its 'programming' related section...all of a sudden,  
I came across a link allowing me to download a FREE Fortran compiler named: SimplyFortran;  
so, I thought to myself I've never ever tried using Fortran before; therefore, why not...?  

But, of course, when it comes to learning to use any programming language that's *new*;  
then, there will also be something of a **learning curve** to go climb...???
