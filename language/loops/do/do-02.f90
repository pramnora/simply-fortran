program fortran_loop

  ! ...This loop counts upwards going from: 1 to 10'; then, immediately, stops.  
  !  I got the code by going to: bing.com/AI based search engine;  
  !  then, asking it to give me Fortran code that counts from 1 to 10.
  
  implicit none
  integer :: i
  do i = 1, 10
  print *, i
  end do

end program fortran_loop
